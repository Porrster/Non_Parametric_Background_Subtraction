# Non_Parametric_Background_Subtraction
This is an implementation of my non-parametric background subtraction algorithm. The code requires the openCV, C++ 11 compilation, and openMP to run. Please only input videos acquired from changedeteciton.net or input videos of the same file format. To compile the code, use the makefile after installing all the required libraries.

Also-
    After installing openCV place the highgui.hpp and imgproc.hpp inside the git folder.
